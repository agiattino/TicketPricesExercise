Ticket Prices Exercise
Create a program that creates a ticket for a user.

If the user is a senior citizen of 65 years or older, they receive a discounted price of $10/ticket.
If the user is 12 years old or younger, they receive a discounted price of $8/ticket.
Otherwise, the full price of a ticket is $14.
